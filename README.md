# Rugby Playbook

There aren't many online tools for creating Rugby plays for free

Features to implement:

- Drag and drop player nodes
- Horizontal/Vertical field views (with field state translating too)
- Ability to create animation slides and generate a sharable link (b64 encoded field state)
- Field presets (lineout, midfield ruck, scrum etc)
